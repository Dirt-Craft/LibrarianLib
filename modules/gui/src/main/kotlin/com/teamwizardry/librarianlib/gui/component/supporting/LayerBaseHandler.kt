     * the children of this component will be checked for layout. This means that changes made in one layer can ripple

     * this layer and its children are laid out, so any changes while laying out will not cause the layout to be
     * recalculated on the next frame.

     * The idea behind this method is that self-contained components/layers can lay out their children dynamically
     * themselves. Examples of such a component would be a self-contained list item, a component that spaces out its
     * children equally along its length, or simply a component that needs to resize its background layer
     * to fit its dimensions.
